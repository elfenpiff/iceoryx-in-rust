# Roadmap

* [ ] Publish Subscribe with history
* [ ] Request Response Messaging Pattern
* [ ] Event Messaging Pattern
* [ ] PubSub, ReqRes, Pipeline variant that works with copies (poor mans mixed criticality)
* [ ] Multi platform support (Android, Mac OS, Windows, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS)
* [ ] C/C++ API
* [ ] ROS2 rmw binding
* [ ] dora-rs integration
* [ ] Publish Subscribe with history
* [ ] Sample Tracking when application crashes
* [ ] Mixed Criticallity setup, e.g. applications do not interfer with each other
* [ ] Identity and Access Management, e.g. service which creates additional services
* [ ] Multi platform support (Android, Mac OS, Windows, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS)
* [ ] Tracing integration for advanced performance measurements, see google chrome chrome://tracing/ and flame graphs
      See lttng, add trace points to the source code on the important functions
* [ ] Further shared memory implementations like Cuda, generic GPU support
* [ ] Blackboard Messaging Pattern
